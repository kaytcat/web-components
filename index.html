          <p>
            The goal of this discussion is to review the new and exciting technologies being specified in
          the web platform today, specifically Web Components. These technologies allow developers to
          create easily maintainable user interfaces that are simple, semantic and reusable. These changes
          however don’t yet enjoy full support from the community or browser vendors and are not yet widely
          practiced. This raises some questions: is this really the future of web development? Has this been
          done before? What are the problems these techniques solve? <br><br>
          This paper plans on answering these questions by investigating the ideas behind modular design
          and the web platform ecosystem. Each Web Components technology will be examined to better
          understand how these technologies can solve current development problems and how they all fit
          together. Lastly, a review of current issues and implementation will be made. By the end of this
          paper all of these concepts and how they work together will have been explored. It is important to
          determine where web development stands today in order to better understand where it might be
          heading in the future. <br><br>
          This paper will discuss ideas and technologies that are very young and not yet standardized or well
          established. Many of the resources that will be used are still in draft, not yet complete, or not yet
          formally published. However, the specification process of the W3C and related working groups is
          integral to innovation on the web, which is a primary focus of this paper.

          <h3><a href="the-web-today">The Web Today</a></h3>
          <p>
          Since the birth of the world wide web in the late 1980’s, major transformations in how
          people and companies relate to each other and share information have occured. This transformation
          can now be seen in almost any major pillar of society - mass availability of information has improved our education system and enabled a more informed public, entertainment has become democratized
          by allowing anyone to be a publisher and the way in which we consume and do business do not
          even resemble the structures that they had less than a quarter century ago (Jaffe, 2014a). Websites
          have evolved from static documents into dynamic applications used across different browsers,
          devices and operating systems. This has been enabled through a collection of open (royalty-free)
          technologies known as the Open Web Platform, built on a core of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. <br><br>
          Today, with the introduction of many different web-enabled devices, many products and companies
          are moving their web-based apps to proprietery mobile platforms. This is notable when looking at
          significant tech products and companies such as Instagram, WhatsApp and SnapChat that are either
          native only or with web as second consideration. Native applications talk directly to the operating
          system giving them speed and capabilites not yet possible on web apps. Today, web applications are
          often perceived as slow, bloated and expensive in comparison with native applications. To keep up
          with native apps, the web platform must continue to grow and add new features (Gasston, 2015).
          </p>

          <h4>Evolving Specifications</h4>

          <p>
            As the web began to grow, so did the need for global interoperability, accessibility, stability
            and quality-control. This lead to the creation of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) in
            1994 (Jaffe, 2014b). Ever since then, the W3C has been bringing together groups of diverse stakeholders
            and public experts to write the technical specifications and guidelines for the web platform.
            The specification process can often take months to years, followed by careful implementation by
            browsers. These delays lead to a stagnating effect on new features in the platform. (Larson, 2015:14).
            Lack of new features prevents the web from moving forward and thus creates major gaps in what
            web developers can do compared to native apps. <br><br>
            The Extensible Web Group, which was formed in 2013, has been trying to solve this problem by
            allowing new low-level features to be implemented in browsers without waiting for the specs to
            be finished. This is done by adding the new features with currently available JavaScript, also called
            polyfilling (Remy, 2013). This allows developers to start using new features right away, including
            Web Components.
          </p>

          <h4>
            Modular Design
          </h4>

          <p>
            It is clear that developers are constantly looking to add structure and efficiency when
            designing web applications, which is where modular-based design comes in. Modularity is an
            important design principle, well known in the back-end programming world for some time.
            The ISO/IEC/IEEE define modularity as “The degree to which a system or computer program is
            composed of discrete components
            such that a change to one component has minimal impact on other components” (ISO/IEC/IEEE,
            2010). The general goal of modularity is that the modules are extensible, reusable and maintainable
            (Meyer, 2007). These principles bring many advantages not only to back-end programming but to
            the front-end as well. <br><br>
            Modular components can be placed into any system and work as expected without conflicting with
            other parts. By making a web application modular, developers are ensuring that a clean foundation
            is set for their project. In the future new developers would not need to know the details of how each
            module works in order to use it (Berners, 2008). Often, in large projects, changes may be required.
            The ability to add new components without breaking the existing code base is crucial in modern
            web development (Cargnelutti, 2008).
          </p>

          <h4>
            What needs Fixing?
          </h4>

          <p>
            As discussed earlier the web is in a transitional state of constant growth and evolution. The
            web platform is already being widely used as an application platform. Developers now have a huge
            selection of libraries and frameworks available to ease application development. However, with such
            a large selection it can be challenging to keep up to date and to know what the appropriate tool for
            any specific job is. Not only that but these component libraries are not always interoperable and can
            cause conflicts when mixing and matching. (Dodson, 2015) Problems can also be found in the core
            of the web platform itself, CSS, HTML and JS. Next, the major issues of the web platform will be
            reviewed.
          </p>

          <h5>
            Coupling and Seperation of Concerns
          </h5>

          <p>
            The traditional computer science idea of separation of concerns says that each section of an
            application should only be responsible for one thing and should not contain code that deals with
            other things. This principle is meant to break down applications into smaller units of encapsulated
            functionality and reduce complexity (Elliot, 2014:99). JS, HTML and CSS are each layers of the
            web platform that under the decoupling principle should be separated. However, this is not often
            the case. The problem is that HTML, CSS and JS are by nature built to interact with each other. <br><br>
            Large projects have trouble keeping their code modular, which often results in tight coupling
            between their HTML, CSS and JS. By not following the principle of separation of concerns, changes
            to one part of a project can inadvertently break unrelated parts elsewhere. This tight coupling is
            most often caused by overly complex CSS selectors. When the CSS file defines complex selectors
            it is often necessary for them to match the HTML structure, thus tightly coupling the styles to the
            markup. Furthermore, JavaScript can also become coupled when needing to select elements using
            the complex selectors. <br><br>
            It is possible to loosen the tight coupling by connecting the HTML, JS and CSS through
            thoughtfully named classes that express their intention and reflect their chosen purpose. However,
            many developers feel using classes that relate to presentation is bad practice and goes againt the
            HTML5 specification section on classes (Walton, 2013a).
          </p>

          <h5>Conflicting CSS</h5>

          <p>
            A major problem with CSS lies in the fact that every CSS selector is global. This means
            every CSS rule that is written has the potential to affect entirely unrelated parts of the application.
            This behavior can cause many problems, including inheritance conflicts, such as rules applied to
            parent elements affecting child component elements or, inversely, rules from components leaking
            and affecting other elements. Additionally, problems can arise from naming conflicts, which is
            when the same class or ID is used by an author unknowingly, thus causing styles to be applied to the
            wrong element. This can be made even worse if JavaScript applies unwanted behaviour to selectors
            that have naming conflicts (Gasston, 2013:192). <br><br>
            There are however, many techniques for avoiding these conflicts such as specific naming conventions
            and logical structure. However these techniques do not solve the underlying global issue and
            conflicts can still occur, especially in large applications or when multiple people are working on a
            single project (Walton, 2013b).
          </p>

          <h5>Extensible HTML</h5>

          <p>
            HTML has come a long way since the W3C published HTML 4.0 in 1997. Originally
            created to build static technical documents, HTML is now used to create rich web applications,
            which is something that it was never designed to do (Berners-Lee, 1989). That said, HTML has
            experienced a lot of progress - today HTML5 has over 100 elements available. However, even with the large range of elements available, HTML5 without Web Components has neither a way
            for authors to define their own elements with unique APIs nor a way to extend existing elements.
            Without the ability to natively create custom elements, the creation of rich user interfaces is more
            difficult than it could be.
          </p>

          <h4><a href="">Solutions</a></h4>

          <p>
            Although these problems are much easier to work around using today’s modern frameworks,
            libraries and APIs, they do not solve the underlying problems. In order for the web to progress and
            make development of applications easier there needs to be a better, standardized solution. These
            problems could be solved if there was a way to make modular, natively extensible, and encapsulated
            components that are supported accross any device and system, which is where Web Components
            come in. <br><br>
            Web Components can be used in multiple applications and provide interoperability between
            frameworks making them reusable and modular. In fact, the entire component’s markup can be
            placed inside a template which follows the separation of concerns principle, thus minimizing tight
            coupling and increasing maintainability of code. Web Components also prevent inheritance and
            naming conflicts by seperating the component from the rest of the DOM (Document Object
            Model), also known as encapsulation. This is enabled through the Shadow DOM which provides
            a private scope rather than a global one. Lastly, Web Components give authors a way to natively
            create new elements and extend HTML. (Patel, 2015:2).

        <div data-id="3" class="chapter-section">
           <h3><a href="the-web-today">What are Web Components</a></h3>

           <p>
             Web Components cannot be summarized as a single thing - but rather a collection of complementary technologies for encapsulating markup, script, and styles intoroduction reusable packages, with native support available in the browser (Buckett, 2015:2). Currently this technology is still
            being specified by the W3C and is only fully supported by Chrome 26+ and Opera 15+. However,
            the Google Chrome Team and many influential web developers including Eric Bidelman, Addy
            Osmani and Dimitri Glazkov are the leading advocates helping to push the process along.
            <br><br>
            This section will discuss how and why web components came about and provide a brief overview of
            how they work. In closing, examples of ways in which we can use this technology will be presented.
           </p>

           <h4>history</h4>

           <p>
             Originally, the term “web components” was used by Microsoft to describe their add-ons to
            Office. Then Sun, now called Oracle, used it to describe Java servlets. Apparently you could even
            get some kind of certification as a “web component” developer from Sun Microsystems (Shapiro,
            D. 2015:8). The word “component” is also not a new one when it comes to CBSE (Component
            Based Software Engineering), which is based on the approach of developing software systems by
            selecting already available components and then assembling them using a well defined software
            architecture (Kaur and Mann, 2010). Since the beginning of 2011 and also currently, the term
            “Web Components” has been used to refer to the new W3C standards. <br><br>
            The development of modern “Web Components” can be traced back to 2005, with the beginning of
            the „AJAX“ revolution and server side RAD (Rapid Application Development) frameworks such as
            Ruby on Rails, CakePHP and Django. These technologies helped advance front-end development
            by delivering content asynchronously while maintaining performance and enabling websites to be
            built in weeks rather than months (Shapiro, 2016:4). Additionally, in 2005, the DOJO toolkit was
            released, allowing developers to add widgets to their websites with only a few lines of code. This
            further underscored the advantages of creating reusable modules.
