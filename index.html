              </h3>
              <p>
                The goal of this discussion is to review the new and exciting technologies being specified in
              the web platform today, specifically Web Components. These technologies allow developers to
              create easily maintainable user interfaces that are simple, semantic and reusable. These changes
              however don’t yet enjoy full support from the community or browser vendors and are not yet widely
              practiced. This raises some questions: is this really the future of web development? Has this been
              done before? What are the problems these techniques solve? <br><br>
              This paper plans on answering these questions by investigating the ideas behind modular design
              and the web platform ecosystem. Each Web Components technology will be examined to better
              understand how these technologies can solve current development problems and how they all fit
              together. Lastly, a review of current issues and implementation will be made. By the end of this
              paper all of these concepts and how they work together will have been explored. It is important to
              determine where web development stands today in order to better understand where it might be
              heading in the future. <br><br>
              This paper will discuss ideas and technologies that are very young and not yet standardized or well
              established. Many of the resources that will be used are still in draft, not yet complete, or not yet
              formally published. However, the specification process of the W3C and related working groups is
              integral to innovation on the web, which is a primary focus of this paper.

                The Web Today
              </h3>

              <p>
              Since the birth of the world wide web in the late 1980’s, major transformations in how
              people and companies relate to each other and share information have occured. This transformation
              can now be seen in almost any major pillar of society - mass availability of information has improved our education system and enabled a more informed public, entertainment has become democratized
              by allowing anyone to be a publisher and the way in which we consume and do business do not
              even resemble the structures that they had less than a quarter century ago<sup><a href="#source1">[1]</a></sup>. Websites
              have evolved from static documents into dynamic applications used across different browsers,
              devices and operating systems. This has been enabled through a collection of open (royalty-free)
              technologies known as the Open Web Platform, built on a core of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. <br><br>
              Today, with the introduction of many different web-enabled devices, many products and companies
              are moving their web-based apps to proprietery mobile platforms. This is notable when looking at
              significant tech products and companies such as Instagram, WhatsApp and SnapChat that are either
              native only or with web as second consideration. Native applications talk directly to the operating
              system giving them speed and capabilites not yet possible on web apps. Today, web applications are
              often perceived as slow, bloated and expensive in comparison with native applications. To keep up
              with native apps, the web platform must continue to grow and add new features<sup><a href="#source2">[2]</a></sup>.
              </p>

              <h4 id="evolving-specifications">
                Evolving Specifications
              </h4>

              <p>
                As the web began to grow, so did the need for global interoperability, accessibility, stability
                and quality-control. This lead to the creation of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) in
                1994<sup><a href="#source3">[3]</a></sup>. Ever since then, the W3C has been bringing together groups of diverse stakeholders
                and public experts to write the technical specifications and guidelines for the web platform.
                The specification process can often take months to years, followed by careful implementation by
                browsers. These delays lead to a stagnating effect on new features in the platform<sup><a href="#source4">[4]</a></sup>.
                Lack of new features prevents the web from moving forward and thus creates major gaps in what
                web developers can do compared to native apps. <br><br>
                The Extensible Web Group, which was formed in 2013, has been trying to solve this problem by
                allowing new low-level features to be implemented in browsers without waiting for the specs to
                be finished. This is done by adding the new features with currently available JavaScript, also called
                polyfilling<sup><a href="">[5]</a></sup>. This allows developers to start using new features right away, including
                Web Components.
              </p>

              <h4 id="modular-design">
                Modular Design
              </h4>

              <p>
                It is clear that developers are constantly looking to add structure and efficiency when
                designing web applications, which is where modular-based design comes in. Modularity is an
                important design principle, well known in the back-end programming world for some time.
                The <a href="https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso-iec-ieee:24765:ed-1:v1:en">ISO/IEC/IEEE</a> define modularity as “The degree to which a system or computer program is
                composed of discrete components
                such that a change to one component has minimal impact on other components”. The general goal of modularity is that the modules are extensible, reusable and maintainable <sup><a href="#source6">[6]</a></sup>. These principles bring many advantages not only to back-end programming but to
                the front-end as well. <br><br>
                Modular components can be placed into any system and work as expected without conflicting with
                other parts. By making a web application modular, developers are ensuring that a clean foundation
                is set for their project. In the future new developers would not need to know the details of how each
                module works in order to use it (Berners, 2008). Often, in large projects, changes may be required.
                The ability to add new components without breaking the existing code base is crucial in modern
                web development<sup><a href="#source7">[7]</a></sup>.
              </p>

                What needs Fixing?
              </h4>

              <p>
                As discussed earlier the web is in a transitional state of constant growth and evolution. The
                web platform is already being widely used as an application platform. Developers now have a huge
                selection of libraries and frameworks available to ease application development. However, with such
                a large selection it can be challenging to keep up to date and to know what the appropriate tool for
                any specific job is. Not only that but these component libraries are not always interoperable and can
                cause conflicts when mixing and matching. (Dodson, 2015) Problems can also be found in the core
                of the web platform itself, CSS, HTML and JS. Next, the major issues of the web platform will be
                reviewed.

              <h5 id="coupling-and-seperation-of-concerns">
                Coupling and Seperation of Concerns
              </h5>

              <p>
                The traditional computer science idea of separation of concerns says that each section of an
                application should only be responsible for one thing and should not contain code that deals with
                other things. This principle is meant to break down applications into smaller units of encapsulated
                functionality and reduce complexity (Elliot, 2014:99). JS, HTML and CSS are each layers of the
                web platform that under the decoupling principle should be separated. However, this is not often
                the case. The problem is that HTML, CSS and JS are by nature built to interact with each other. <br><br>
                Large projects have trouble keeping their code modular, which often results in tight coupling
                between their HTML, CSS and JS. By not following the principle of separation of concerns, changes
                to one part of a project can inadvertently break unrelated parts elsewhere. This tight coupling is
                most often caused by overly complex CSS selectors. When the CSS file defines complex selectors
                it is often necessary for them to match the HTML structure, thus tightly coupling the styles to the
                markup. Furthermore, JavaScript can also become coupled when needing to select elements using
                the complex selectors. <br><br>
                It is possible to loosen the tight coupling by connecting the HTML, JS and CSS through
                thoughtfully named classes that express their intention and reflect their chosen purpose. However,
                many developers feel using classes that relate to presentation is bad practice and goes againt the
                HTML5 specification section on classes (Walton, 2013a).

                Conflicting CSS
              </h5>

              <p>
                A major problem with CSS lies in the fact that every CSS selector is global. This means
                every CSS rule that is written has the potential to affect entirely unrelated parts of the application.
                This behavior can cause many problems, including inheritance conflicts, such as rules applied to
                parent elements affecting child component elements or, inversely, rules from components leaking
                and affecting other elements. Additionally, problems can arise from naming conflicts, which is
                when the same class or ID is used by an author unknowingly, thus causing styles to be applied to the
                wrong element. This can be made even worse if JavaScript applies unwanted behaviour to selectors
                that have naming conflicts (Gasston, 2013:192). <br><br>
                There are however, many techniques for avoiding these conflicts such as specific naming conventions
                and logical structure. However these techniques do not solve the underlying global issue and
                conflicts can still occur, especially in large applications or when multiple people are working on a
                single project (Walton, 2013b).

                Extensible HTML
              </h5>

              <p>
                HTML has come a long way since the W3C published HTML 4.0 in 1997. Originally
                created to build static technical documents, HTML is now used to create rich web applications,
                which is something that it was never designed to do (Berners-Lee, 1989). That said, HTML has
                experienced a lot of progress - today HTML5 has over 100 elements available. However, even with the large range of elements available, HTML5 without Web Components has neither a way
                for authors to define their own elements with unique APIs nor a way to extend existing elements.
                Without the ability to natively create custom elements, the creation of rich user interfaces is more
                difficult than it could be.

                Solutions
              </h4>

              <p>
                Although these problems are much easier to work around using today’s modern frameworks,
                libraries and APIs, they do not solve the underlying problems. In order for the web to progress and
                make development of applications easier there needs to be a better, standardized solution. These
                problems could be solved if there was a way to make modular, natively extensible, and encapsulated
                components that are supported accross any device and system, which is where Web Components
                come in. <br><br>
                Web Components can be used in multiple applications and provide interoperability between
                frameworks making them reusable and modular. In fact, the entire component’s markup can be
                placed inside a template which follows the separation of concerns principle, thus minimizing tight
                coupling and increasing maintainability of code. Web Components also prevent inheritance and
                naming conflicts by seperating the component from the rest of the DOM (Document Object
                Model), also known as encapsulation. This is enabled through the Shadow DOM which provides
                a private scope rather than a global one. Lastly, Web Components give authors a way to natively
                create new elements and extend HTML. (Patel, 2015:2).

               <p>
                 Web Components cannot be summarized as a single thing - but rather a collection of complementary technologies for encapsulating markup, script, and styles intoroduction reusable packages, with native support available in the browser (Buckett, 2015:2). Currently this technology is still
                being specified by the W3C and is only fully supported by Chrome 26+ and Opera 15+. However,
                the Google Chrome Team and many influential web developers including Eric Bidelman, Addy
                Osmani and Dimitri Glazkov are the leading advocates helping to push the process along.
                <br><br>
                This section will discuss how and why web components came about and provide a brief overview of
                how they work. In closing, examples of ways in which we can use this technology will be presented.

               <h4 id="history">history</h4>

               <p>
                 Originally, the term “web components” was used by Microsoft to describe their add-ons to
                Office. Then Sun, now called Oracle, used it to describe Java servlets. Apparently you could even
                get some kind of certification as a “web component” developer from Sun Microsystems (Shapiro,
                D. 2015:8). The word “component” is also not a new one when it comes to CBSE (Component
                Based Software Engineering), which is based on the approach of developing software systems by
                selecting already available components and then assembling them using a well defined software
                architecture (Kaur and Mann, 2010). Since the beginning of 2011 and also currently, the term
                “Web Components” has been used to refer to the new W3C standards. <br><br>
                The development of modern “Web Components” can be traced back to 2005, with the beginning of
                the „AJAX“ revolution and server side RAD (Rapid Application Development) frameworks such as
                Ruby on Rails, CakePHP and Django. These technologies helped advance front-end development
                by delivering content asynchronously while maintaining performance and enabling websites to be
                built in weeks rather than months (Shapiro, 2016:4). Additionally, in 2005, the DOJO toolkit was
                released, allowing developers to add widgets to their websites with only a few lines of code. This
                further underscored the advantages of creating reusable modules.
                <br><br>
                In 2006 the JavaScript library jQuery was revealed. This library allowed developers to write JavaScript
                programs leveraging a simplified API for DOM interaction across a large range of web browsers. This
                helped kick off the era of “single page apps”. Accompanying the success of jQuery came many other
                front-end libraries, toolkits and frameworks including YUI, Prototype and Extjs - each including
                their own stock widget libraries. The time period around 2010 saw major progress in client-side
                development and the popularity of single page apps, which lead to client-side implementations of
                MV*(Model View Whatever) patterns. Here, the importance of reusable and well-encapsulated UI
                components became increasingly relevant due to code bloat in large-scale single page web apps and
                front-end frameworks (Shapiro, 2016:9). <br><br>
                Today these front-end libraries, toolkits and frameworks all appear to have major limitations - they
                do not interact well together, nor can developers easily mix and match components from different
                frameworks or libraries. Another major limitation when working with component based libraries
                is the browser platforms themselves. If the browser vendors had successfully built capabilities to
                encapsulate, package, and re-use code in HTML and DOM APIs before the AJAX revolution,
                modern web development would perhaps be very different today. This is what Web Components
                has to offer - native browser support for extending, packaging, encapsulating, and importing UI
                components. <br><br>
                Google has been the leading advocate for web components since the first W3C draft in May of
                2012, which was edited by Google’s own Dimitri Glazkov and Hayato Ito. Google’s investment
                in web components was made evident during 2013’s Google I/O where they announced Polymer,
                their own library to build components. Since then, many resource websites such as webcomponents.
                org and customelements.io and frameworks such as X-tag and Bosonic have appeared, enabling
                modern implementation of web components with better browser support.
               </p>

              <h5 id="has-this-been-done-before">Has this been done before?</h5>

                <p>
                  The idea of encapsulating components certainly solves many issues with the web platform.
                  It begs the question: why hasn’t this been done sooner? In fact, several past HTML component
                  technologies have been proposed, but not with much success. <br><br>
                  HTML Components (HTC for short) was proposed to the W3C by Microsoft in 1998. Microsoft felt
                  that with the absence of reusable HTML components, the growth of web application development
                  would be limitied (Wilson, 1998). Their proposal used a declarative model for attaching events
                  and APIs to a host element and then parsed components would be attached to a “viewlink”, which
                  would be comparable to today’s Shadow DOM. <br><br>
                  Mozilla also implemented their own version of web components with XBL 1.0 (Xenogamous
                  Binding Language) in 2001, and then followed up with a successor, XBL 2.0, in 2007. Similar to
                  Microsofts HTML Components, XBL declaratively describes the ability to associate elements in a
                  document with other HTML, JS and CSS (Hickson, 2012). <br><br>
                  After Microsoft’s and Mozilla’s failed attempts at creating web components, Google is now leading
                  the proposals. But these failed attempts did not go without notice. Both the documents from XBL
                  1.0 and XBL 2.0 provided tremendous insight into the problem of functional encapsulation and
                  greatly influenced the Shadow DOM specification (Glazkov and Ito, 2015a).
                </p>

                <h5 id="overview">Overview</h5>

                <p>
                  Each HTML element, whether it’s a<code>&lt;button&gt;</code>,<code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>or<code>&lt;input&gt;</code> element, has a defined API
                  and support built into the web browser. When you use these tags, the browser takes data supplied
                  from your markup, renders the element, and reacts accordingly to user and script actions (Buckett,2015:2). Elements range in complexity from simple <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>'s to complex elements like the date
                  selector input element. The date selector is composed of many child elements that show and hide
                  in response to user input. Furthermore, all styling is already applied without additional css scripts
                  being imported and this styling does not leak to the rest of the page. The date selector shows how
                  an element itself encapsulates the internal markup, scripts and stylesheets. With web components
                  developers can build such elements through the use of four W3C specifications - Custom Elements,
                  HTML Templates, Shadow DOM and HTML Imports. These combined technologies allow
                  developers to encapsulate markup, scripts, and stylesheets into reusable packages, with native
                  support available in the browser.
                </p>

                <h5 id="possibilities">Possibilities</h5>
                <p>
                  Since web components are still in the drafting phase, changes are still to come. However, it
                  is possible to imagine how Web Components could change the foundation of web development.
                  As an example, imagine embedding a YouTube video using a <code>&lt;youtube-video&gt;</code> component or
                  displaying a Facebook profile on a web page or blog with a <code>&lt;facebook-profile&gt;</code>. By designing an
                  app in this way, it is possible to break an application down into the smallest reusable pieces of
                  functionality and then to recombine those pieces into a modular application. You can mix your
                  own components with those from third parties and other developers can take your components and
                  re-use them in their applications (Buckett, 2013:6-7). Entire applications can even be built using
                  a single component. This paradigm shift that componentization brings to web development could
                  also open the field to non-technical people, enabling pluggable components with little or no coding
                  knowledge required.

                 As discussed earlier, web components are made up of four W3C specifications, Custom Elmenets, HTML Templates, Shadow DOM and HTML Imports. These specifications are the
                building blocks of what makes up Web Components. This section will review each of the four
                current specifications in detail to better understand how this technology is extending the web
                platform and helping with web development. It is important to note that these specifications are
                not yet complete and are still being modified and reviewed.
